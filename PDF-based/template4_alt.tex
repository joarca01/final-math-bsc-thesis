$1+c_1x+c_2x^2$, $c_i\in\Z$, for $i=1,2$. Note that $Q$ divides every $c_i$ . This polynomial $g$ must also have at least one prime divisor, say $p$, for the same reason as before. Therefore, $p$ divides $g(m)$ for some $m\in\Z$, and this implies that $p$ divides $\Phi_{{k}}(Qm)$. Since $m':=Qm\in\Z$, it follows that $p$ is a prime divisor of $\Phi_{{k}}$. But $p$ does not divide $Q$, since $p$ dividing $Q$ would mean that $p$ divides $c_i$, for $i=1,2$ (recall that $Q$ divides every $c_i$).
