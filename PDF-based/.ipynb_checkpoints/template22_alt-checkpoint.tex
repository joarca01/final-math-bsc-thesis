If the order of ${u}$ is a divisor of ${k}$ different from ${k}$, say $k'$, then ${u}$ is also a root of $\Phi_{k''}(x) \bmod{q}$ for some divisor $k''$ of $k'$, and hence of ${k}$. Thus, ${u}$ is a multiple root of $x^{{k}}-1 \bmod{q}$, since both $\Phi_{{k}}(x)$ and $\Phi_{k''}(x)$ divide $x^{{k}}-1$. But then ${u}$ would also be a root of the derivative of $x^{{k}}-1 \bmod{q}$, that is, of ${k}x^{{kmenys1}}\bmod{q}$. {argument_k_u_diff_alt} Fermat little theorem guarantees that the order of ${u}$ divides the order of $(\Z/q\Z)^\times$ $q-1$, which is $\varphi(q)=q-1$. Thus, ${k}$ divides $q-1$. We then have $q-1\equiv 0\pmod{{k}}$, so $q\equiv 1\pmod{{k}}$.
