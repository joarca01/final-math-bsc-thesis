$1+c_1x+\cdots+c_{{eulersphi_k}}x^{{eulersphi_k}}$, $c_i\in\Z$, for every $1\leqslant i \leqslant {eulersphi_k}$. Note that $Q$ divides every $c_i$. This polynomial $g$ must also have at least one prime divisor, say $p$, for the same reason as before. Therefore, $p$ divides $g(m)$ for some $m\in\Z$, and this implies that $p$ divides $\Phi_{{k}}(Qm)$. Since $m':=Qm\in\Z$, it follows that $p$ is a prime divisor of $\Phi_{{k}}$. But $p$ does not divide $Q$, since $p$ dividing $Q$ would mean that $p$ divides $c_i$, for every $1\leqslant i \leqslant {eulersphi_k}$ (recall that $Q$ divides every $c_i$).
