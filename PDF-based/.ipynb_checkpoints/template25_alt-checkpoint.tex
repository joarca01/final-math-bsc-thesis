But this is not possible since $q$ does not divide ${k}$ nor ${u}$. On one hand, the fact that ${u}^{{k}}\equiv 1\pmod{q}$ means that ${u}\not\equiv 0\pmod{q}$. On the other hand, since ${u}$ is a multiple of ${k}$, if ${k}\equiv 0\pmod{q}$ then ${u}\equiv 0\pmod{q}$, which we have just seen is not possible. Therefore, the order of ${u}$ must be ${k}$.
